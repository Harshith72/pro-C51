            Here are some unique designs of origami which you might like </h2>

        <p>At its essence, origami is the traditional Japanese game of folding elaborately designed paper into a myriad
            of shapes, typically plants, animals, and other living things.<br>Part of what makes origami unique is the
            fact that it simplyrequires a piece of paper and a creative imagination.</p>

                    <li> columbidae (/kəˈlʌmbɪdiː/) is a bird family consisting of pigeons and doves. It is the only
                        family
                        in the order Columbiformes. </li>

                        feature
                        fleshy ceres. They primarily feed on seeds, fruits, and plants. The family occurs worldwide, but
                        the
                        greatest variety is in the Indomalayan and Australasian realms </li>
                    <li>Doves and pigeons build relatively flimsy nests, often using sticks and other debris, which may

                        placed on branches of trees, on ledges, or on the ground, depending on species. They lay one or
                        (usually) two white eggs at a time, and both parents care for the young, which leave the nest
                        after
                        25–32 days. </li>

                        company in

                    <li> Named after President Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt, the teddy bear became a popular children's
                        toy,
                        celebrated in story, song, and film.. </li>

                        "teddies" have greatly varied in form, style, color, and material. </li>
