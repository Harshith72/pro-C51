            <p>At its essence, origami is the traditional Japanese game of folding elaborately designed paper into a myriad
                of shapes, typically plants, animals, and other living things.<br>Part of what makes origami unique is the
                fact that it simplyrequires a piece of paper and a creative imagination.</p>
